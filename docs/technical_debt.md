# Nova Aegis Technical Debt Ledger

## Purpose

This ledger records implementation debt, discovered defects, broken behavior, temporary decisions, and architectural questions. It prevents temporary MVP choices from becoming invisible permanent constraints.

Every phase must update this document before it is considered complete.

## Phase Record

Each phase record must answer:

- What changed?
- What broke or was discovered?
- What is the root cause?
- What fix was applied or proposed?
- Why was that fix chosen?
- What risk remains?
- Is refactoring required?
- Which threat, invariant, or architecture section is related?
- Which tests were added?
- Which tests are still missing?

## Status Values

- **Open:** known debt or defect remains.
- **In progress:** an owned fix is being implemented.
- **Mitigated:** risk is reduced, but the underlying debt remains.
- **Resolved:** the cause is fixed and validated.
- **Accepted:** consciously retained with rationale, owner, and review date.
- **Blocked:** cannot be resolved until a named dependency or decision is available.

## Severity Values

- **Critical:** threatens confidentiality, authorization, governance, or a security invariant.
- **High:** can cause unsafe behavior, material data exposure, incorrect assurance, or architectural boundary failure.
- **Medium:** meaningful defect or maintainability risk without immediate critical impact.
- **Low:** localized cleanup or minor usability/clarity issue.

## Current Phase Records

### TD-001 - Dependency-free MVP infrastructure

- **Phase:** 1
- **Status:** Accepted for MVP
- **Severity:** Medium
- **What changed:** Added a dependency-free local retrieval, evidence citation, response assurance, audit, and synthetic-tool slice.
- **What broke or was discovered:** The MVP does not yet use a persistent document store, graph database, vector index, Foundry Local, or a real MCP transport.
- **Root cause:** The first vertical slice intentionally minimizes infrastructure so the authority boundary can be tested before platform integration.
- **Fix or next step:** Keep the provider, storage, and tool interfaces replaceable; introduce each dependency only behind a tested boundary.
- **Why this fix:** It validates governance behavior without prematurely coupling the architecture to runtime or storage choices.
- **Remaining risk:** In-memory state is not durable, multi-user safe, or production-ready.
- **Refactor required:** Yes before production or multi-session deployment; no before the next MVP behavior slice.
- **Related controls:** High-level architecture, INV-AUTH-001, INV-GOV-001, INV-NET-001.
- **Tests added:** Local evidence PASS, missing evidence REVIEW, unauthorized tool BLOCK, authorized tool execution, Praetor outage fail-closed.
- **Tests still missing:** Persistence isolation, concurrent sessions, real MCP boundary, model-provider contract, and network enforcement.

## Debt Rules

1. Critical debt cannot be silently accepted.
2. A security-invariant failure is tracked as a release blocker for the affected operating profile.
3. A workaround must include the reason it exists and the condition that permits its removal.
4. Debt discovered during a phase is recorded in the same phase, even when the fix is deferred.
5. Accepted debt receives an owner and review date.
6. Resolved debt requires an executable validation result.
7. The five-phase audit reviews every open, mitigated, accepted, and blocked item.
